Arch Linux Installation for Jon Webb!
=====================================
My name is Jon Webb and I am an engineer and scientist that specializes
in Aerospace Engineering, Nuclear Engineering, and Computer Science.
As part of my job and personal life, I frequently use Macintosh computers
which have a rich set of features that are enabled by a Linux-like interface
with Bash and ZShell shell environments.  This document describes the 
configuration processes that I use to install software development tools,
compilers, integrated developer environments, and relational database 
management systems.
